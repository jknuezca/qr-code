## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I figured out that you can use the css below to set the positioning of properties, without using "transform:translate();".

```css
body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    width: 100vw;
}
```

### Continued development

Even if you've built websites in the past, practice is still crucial, thus I want to keep honing my development abilities. Reverting to the fundamentals is important.
